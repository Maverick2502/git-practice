Mace Windu, a prominent Jedi Master, serves as one of the most respected members of the Jedi Council during the waning days of the Galactic Republic. 
Renowned for his wisdom, combat prowess, and unshakable adherence to the Jedi Code, Windu wields a distinctive purple-bladed lightsaber, symbolizing his mastery of both the Light Side and a controlled use of aggressive combat techniques through the Vaapad fighting style.  

Windu plays a pivotal role in the events leading to the Clone Wars, often clashing ideologically with Anakin Skywalker while striving to protect the Republic. 
His final confrontation with Chancellor Palpatine reveals the Sith Lord's identity as Darth Sidious, a moment that triggers the Jedi Purge and the rise of the Galactic Empire.
